# Visualizing the Investment in the Neighborhoods of Toronto and relative Tax Estimation on Residential Properties

This is a technical test of visualizing the investment in the neighborhoods of Toronto and relative Tax Estimation on Residential Properties

# Open Data used from the City of Toronto

Several geographical data sources of the Open Data initiative of the City of Toronto are used (taken to the WGS84 coordinate system, which
most of them offer):

# The very First Version of the Visualization

This is the very first version of the [Visualization](TO_developm_neighborhoods.png). Further work on this is coming.

# Analysis

As mentioned above, this is just a technical test of visualizing the investment in the neighborhoods of Toronto and relative Tax Estimation on Residential Properties: a more throughout Data Mining could be possible as to visualize why certain neighborhoods are chosen, etc, but these are social and urban planning projections for the future of Toronto, so Data Mining on them could be computationally expensive. (This could be interesting and useful on its own: the City of Toronto offers many more sources of information in its [Open Data program](http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=9e56e03bb8d1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD)
